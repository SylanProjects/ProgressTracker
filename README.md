# ProgressTracker
 
**About**

This project will be an native android application written in Java using Android Studio. 
The aim will be to release this app through app store for free for users to use. 
It will be used to help users track progress overtime. It should be able to track
any kind of progress like exercise, study time/topic, to-dos etc.
Users will be able to add exercise or a study topic, and select what they did during that day,
for example, they will be able to add that they studied Data Structures for 1 hour on Monday and 
then see how many hours they studied that topic throughout a week/month/year. 
The aim is also to alow users to add their schedule which would remind them what they need to do
each day etc.
